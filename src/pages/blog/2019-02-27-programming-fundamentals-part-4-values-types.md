  Part 4 of our programming fundamentals. Values & Types. You can do a lot of
  things with values while programming, but what you do with it might just
  determine the type of value it is!

What you plan on doing with your values will determine the types of values you will be setting.

Use `Number` if you need to do math with the value.

Use `String` if you need to print out a string of characters. 

If a yes or no / true or false decision needs to be made use `Boolean`.

Values included directly in your code are literal values. String literals are surrounded by quotes I.E `"My String Value"`. Literal numbers and booleans are included without quotes I.E `26`, or `true`.

Some Javascript examples are:

```js
26;
"Your most excellent string"
'Single quotes work too!'
false;
true;
```

Besides those 3 value types some other common types would be functions, arrays, objects, and more! I will talk about these other types later on.

## Converting Between Types

Sometimes you're in a situation where you need to convert value types so you can use them in a different manner.
